# LifeInADayAtFacebook
A day of life in social media through visual analytics

There has been significant rise in number of users in social networks over the time. These users have different types of interactions in the social network. If we consider Facebook, likes, comments, posts are most common modes of the interactions. In twitter people tweet, retweet, follow, hashtag etc. There is no doubt that people spend quite significant amount of their time per day in these social network and their time remains unaccounted.

So we thought of visualizing the time spend by the users in social network in terms of interactions. Our project titled “Life in a day at Facebook” or LIADAF will take an account of user activities in Facebook and provide meaningful insights. The main goal of the project is to highlight the interaction traffic in Facebook within a day through visual analytics. We have highlighted 6 time frames within a day namely, midnight to 4 am, 4 am to 8 am, 8 am to 12 pm, 12 pm to 16 pm, 16 pm to 20 pm and finally 20 pm to midnight.
We are likely to target our application to the Facebook and Twitter users (16-32 years) who would like to view and perhaps decide how have they usually spend their time in social medias.

Our main objectives are:
1.      To find out how user spend their time in Facebook or Twitter daily
2.      To find out the average latency in interactions done in user Facebook or Twitter page.
3.      To view the activities in Facebook or Twitter in a moving timeline at our own speed.
